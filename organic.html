                            <p class="card-text">Monsoon is the time of year when you want hot, crispy pakoras and samosas. You have no idea how these crunchy snacks might damage your health. Consuming a lot of fried meals might make you tired and overweight. The monsoon
                                season brings with it a slew of illnesses, allergies, rashes, and diseases such as cholera and malaria. You must eat the correct kinds of foods in order to equip your body to combat such illnesses. Aside from spicy vegetable
                                curries and chicken soups, there is one food type that you should consume: fruits. While the humid temperature of the monsoons makes it difficult to digest meals, fruits make it simpler to do so. Viruses, allergies, and
                                other seasonal ailments such as malaria are all brought on by the monsoons. Digestion is slowed by the humidity in the environment, which creates digestive issues. Fruit consumption during the rainy season might aid digestion
                                and possibly enhance the immune system. However, you should eat fruits in moderation. Continue reading to find out why: What You Need to Know: Why are fruits deemed dangerous during the rainy season? Which fruits might
                                help enhance immunity during the rainy season? Why are fruits deemed dangerous during the rainy season? Experts believe fruits to be a healthy alternative during the monsoon provided they are consumed fresh and thoroughly
                                cleaned. Fruits and green vegetables, on the other hand, tend to have an abundance of germs that may cause disease, prompting some to recommend avoiding these meals during the monsoon in India. You should avoid eating pre-cut
                                fruits and fruit drinks from roadside sellers since the air might infect them. Even at home, you should chop fruits and eat them as soon as possible. If you keep the fruits clean, they may be a healthy addition to your
                                monsoon diet. Which fruits might help enhance immunity during the rainy season? When picking fruits to include in your diet during the monsoon, seek fruits that are currently in season. Here are some rainy season fruits
                                to eat to boost your immunity. Cherries During the monsoon season, cherries are plentiful. These are low in calories and high in antioxidants, which aid in infection prevention and inflammation relief. Apart from that,
                                cherries are beneficial to your health in a variety of ways. They have anti-carcinogenic qualities and aid in the reduction of bad cholesterol. They also aid in lowering blood pressure and uric acid levels. Cherries may
                                be used in purees, jams, and tarts. They do, however, taste best when eaten whole. Cherries have a low-calorie count and are high in antioxidants. Plums Plums are high in dietary fibre, copper, potassium, Vitamin C, and
                                Vitamin K. Plums contain the reddish-blue pigment anthocyanins, which may protect you against cancer.
